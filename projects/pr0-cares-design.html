                    <p>
                       CARES (Child Welfare Services - California Automated Response and Engagement System) is California's modern digital platform replacing the outdated 1997 CWS/CMS.

                       <br> <br>
                       CARES is a Salesforce-based platform that will be used by over <strong>100,000 users across California</strong>, including social workers, supervisors, and administrators. It aims to streamline workflows, improve data accuracy, and enhance collaboration among child welfare professionals.</p>

                        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                        <p>I started on a 150+ cross functional team addressing the many sub-areas of the Child Welfare System of California and was placed on a smaller cross-functional team as a UX Designer with a technical analyst, business analyst and a scrum lead. As a UX Designer, I was also a part of the Design Team, consisting of 8-10 designers and design leads.

                        <p>I built prototypes in Figma to visualize the Salesforce implementation of the business requirements for presentation to the client-side stakeholders, worked with my core scrum team to update the prototypes for additional reviews with the client as needed, and get approval for implementation.</p>

                        <h2>Growing as a Cross-Functional Designer</h2>
                        <p>As I continued to build a deeper understanding of Child Welfare Systems as well as the complexity of use cases for state as large as 
                            California, I navigated more complex designs such as creation of a new case for a child, assignment of the child's case, capturing data 
                            related to the child's placements, removals from the placements, and eligibility determination for financial assistance.</p>

                            Furthermore, with the growing deliverables for the design team for different areas in the system, I also took initiative early on to build a library of most commonly used screen templates with Salesforce components such as related lists, input fields, quick links panels, cards, detail layouts, etc. This sped up designers within many other scrum teams including mine and helped us build a shared understanding of what the most recent version of a screen is to be used in cross-functional designs.

                        <p>Along with building design flows, I also progressed to independently drive internal and client stakeholder conversations around topics such as the usability, technical design, user access and permissions to data, etc.</p>

                            <li>Presented at client walkthroughs of the designs to collect feedback from actual users at the early stage. </li>

                        <p>
                           In a complex, ever-evolving Salesforce ecosystem, adaptability was key. I ensured design quality stayed consistent even as technical and business strategies shifted — all while communicating changes effectively across teams.

                        <p>
                            Adding components isn't enough. I learned to document clearly, communicate proactively, and often repeat the “why” behind UX decisions — especially for cross-functional teams not steeped in UX thinking.

                        <p> Instead of diving into perfect Figma files, I learn to begin each deliverable with: “What is this for?”
                            Whether for dev handoffs, client demos, or internal reviews — I tailored fidelity and details to the audience and use case.</p>
