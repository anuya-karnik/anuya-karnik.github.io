                    <h2>Challenges of the Legacy System - CWS/CMS </h2>
                    <p>
                        Originally built in 1997, the Child Welfare Services/Case Management System (CWS/CMS) had the
                        following limitations:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technologically outdated</strong> — The system lacked the flexibility needed to
                            support evolving workflows and modern user needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>No mobile compatibility</strong> — Caseworkers in the field could not access or
                            input information in real time, leading to delays and inefficiencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not user-centered</strong> — Workflows were designed around rigid data entry rather
                            than intuitive, service-oriented processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Difficult to update or maintain</strong> — Even minor changes required lengthy
                            rollout cycles, making the system increasingly unsustainable over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                <h2>How CARES Aims At Mitigating These Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    CARES (California Automated Response and Engagement System) was designed to address the key
                    limitations of the legacy CWS/CMS system by introducing a more modern, user-centered platform:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Modern, flexible architecture</strong> — Built on Salesforce Lightning, CARES supports
                        evolving workflows and continuous system improvements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile-first design</strong> — Responsive layouts and mobile-friendly components enable
                        caseworkers to work effectively in the field.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-centered workflows</strong> — Interfaces and task flows are designed based on real
                        user research, improving efficiency and reducing cognitive load.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agile and maintainable</strong> — Modular design allows for faster updates and rollouts,
                        ensuring the platform can evolve with changing policies and needs.</li>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>I started on a 150+ cross functional team addressing the many sub-areas of the Child Welfare System
                    of California and was placed on a smaller cross-functional team as a UX Designer with a technical
                    analyst, business analyst and a scrum lead. As a UX Designer, I was also a part of the Design Team,
                    consisting of 8-10 designers and design leads.

                <h2>Growing as a Cross-Functional Designer</h2>
                <p>As I continued to build a deeper understanding of Child Welfare Systems as well as the complexity of
                    use cases for state as large as
                    California, I navigated more complex designs such as creation of a new case for a child, assignment
                    of the child's case, capturing data
                    related to the child's placements, removals from the placements, and eligibility determination for
                    financial assistance.</p>

                    Furthermore, with the growing deliverables for the design team for different areas in the system, I
                    also took initiative early on to build a library of most commonly used screen templates with
                    Salesforce components such as related lists, input fields, quick links panels, cards, detail
                    layouts, etc. This sped up designers within many other scrum teams including mine and helped us
                    build a shared understanding of what the most recent version of a screen is to be used in
                    cross-functional designs.

                <p>
                    Over the first two years of the project, there were several challenges related to establishing a
                    consistent experience throughout the system:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Multiple Client Stakeholders</strong><br>
                        Various service areas within CARES had their own client stakeholders, each with different
                        expectations for how platform features should be designed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Siloed Design Approaches</strong><br>
                        To meet these varied expectations, multiple teams designed solutions in semi-siloed
                        environments, using a mix of custom Lightning Web Components (LWCs), OmniScript flows, and
                        configurable Salesforce components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Inconsistent User Experience</strong><br>
                        This led to variation in the overall experience across the platform, contributing to
                        inconsistencies, usability issues, and an increased number of bugs and defects identified by the
                        testing team.

                    To mitigate inconsistencies and create a unified design language across the CARES platform, I
                    collaborated with the design team and cross-functional partners to develop a system-wide library of
                    reusable components and templates.
                </p>

                <p><strong>This initiative was grounded in the following efforts:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Assessing platform-wide needs</strong><br>
                        We conducted an audit of existing workflows and identified common UI patterns and user pain
                        points to guide the foundational design requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cross-functional alignment on constraints</strong><br>
                        I facilitated ongoing communication with developers, architects, and functional leads to
                        understand technical limitations and ensure each template could be implemented within the
                        constraints of Salesforce (LWC, OmniScript, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Centralized design documentation</strong><br>
                        We created a shared design library in Figma for the core UX/UI team and paired it with detailed
                        documentation in Confluence for use by developers, business analysts, and stakeholders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Advocacy and early adoption</strong><br>
                        I led client walkthroughs and feedback sessions to socialize the new library, promote a shared
                        design vocabulary, and encourage early buy-in across teams.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Outcomes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Centralized resources for all teams</strong><br>
                        Over 250 team members—including designers, developers, analysts, and QA—had access to a unified
                        set of templates and documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shared language across disciplines</strong><br>
                        Designers, developers, architects, and business analysts were aligned through a consistent
                        visual and functional design system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Faster implementation cycles</strong><br>
                        Reusable patterns and pre-approved components accelerated development and reduced the need for
                        repeated design-developer handoffs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Higher client acceptance and engagement</strong><br>
                        Involving clients early in the design system's development led to greater trust, early buy-in,
                        and smoother approvals during reviews.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                        In a complex, ever-evolving Salesforce ecosystem, adaptability was key. I ensured design quality
                        stayed consistent even as technical and business strategies shifted — all while communicating
                        changes effectively across teams.

                    <p>
                        Adding components isn't enough. I learned to document clearly, communicate proactively, and
                        often repeat the “why” behind UX decisions — especially for cross-functional teams not steeped
                        in UX thinking.

                    <p> Instead of diving into perfect Figma files, I learn to begin each deliverable with: “What is
                        this for?”
                        Whether for dev handoffs, client demos, or internal reviews — I tailored fidelity and details to
                        the audience and use case.</p>

                    <p> Great UX happens through close collaboration. Partnering early with developers, BAs, and QA
                        ensured designs were feasible, testable, and aligned with real-world constraints.</p>
