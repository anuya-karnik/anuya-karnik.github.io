                    <p>The PIT Team at the University of Michigan aims to shape the field of PIT into a more equitable
                        environment by creating the PIT Knowledge Network (PIT-KN). This platform has two main goals:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a thriving environment where PIT Entrepreneurs can share <strong>tacit knowledge</strong>
                            in the form of experiences
                            and stories.</li>
                        <li>Convert and present this tacit knowledge as <strong>explicit knowledge</strong> to be used by
                            other entrepreneurs, students, or practitioners in the field of PIT.</li>

                    <h2>Assessing User Needs: The PIT Entrepreneurs</h2>
                    <p>I started working when the project was in the discovery phase and 10 interviews with PIT
                        Entrepreneurs (or PITers) had been conducted.</p>
                    <p>
                        To make sure PIT Entrepreneurs, the primary target users, remain central to the design of the
                        platform, I started by analyzing the user interviews with the goal of extracting meaningful and
                        well-defined objectives for the PITKN and further converted the interpretation notes to an
                        <strong>Affinity Analysis</strong>.

                        for my team to add ideas for how might we address some of them. This brought forward a great host of

                        they
                        meet or don't meet the requirements of PIT Entrepreneurs. Thus, I combined the knowledge of user
                        pain points and user needs with a competitive analysis of platforms widely used by businesses and
                        non-profits for their networking needs to find which features are
                        beneficial for the PIT Knowledge Network as well as how our platform could better serve the needs of

                    <p>For my final task, I contributed in developing a survey for PIT Entpreneurs as well as Students
                        interested in the field of PIT. This survey used scenarios to better explain the purpose of the
                        Knowledge Network and assess whether students and PITers would find the current features useful. A
                        link to the prototype was also included in the survey to enhance the understanding of the
                        respondents.

                    <p>The Interactive Prototype was found to be very useful by the PIT Team for various purposes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It serves as a design guide for the working prototype of the actual platform</li>
                        <li>It was recently included at several demos, kick-offs and presentations to visualize the platform
                            and its outcomes </li>
                        <li>It was also used to collect feedback from PIT Entrepreneurs and Students in a survey. The
                            suggestions and feedback were documented and can be used in the next iteration of implementing
                            ideas and making improvements to the prototypes. </li>
