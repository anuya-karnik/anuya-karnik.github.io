                    <h1>Zemory - Image Organization Application</h1>
                    <p>Zemory is an interactive, multipurpose web interface for millennial parents to collect, organize,
                        as well as create sharable collages from their children's photos. ​</p>

                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started my ideation by finding out how parents organize their children's photos and how they
                        further use them for creative projects such as collages and photo books. To strengthen my
                        research, I further conducted four user interviews with parents of
                        children between the ages of 0-15 years and found out that: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parents backup their children's pictures on multiple storage spaces including cloud storage
                            and physical memory devices such as hard drives.</li>
                        <li>They often have goals to collect the best photos of their children and organize them
                            creatively in photobooks and collages, especially for occasions like graduation and
                            birthdays.</li>
                        <li>Some parents also want to filter and collect the best photos to create meaningful
                            collections that they can pass on to their kids.</li>
                        <li>Before backing their phone pictures, most parents do not go into their collections and sort
                            and remove duplicate or blur photos; they simply upload photos as a bulk.</li>

                    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
                    <p>Using my ideation, I brainstormed and sketched possible solutions for approaching the problem.
                        These sketches allowed me to define my ideas and how they would act as a tool for the user. It
                        was important to put the user at the forefront
                        at this stage as it would allow me to see which of my solutions would work the best in solving
                        the user's problem.</p>

                        I further worked on evaluating the best solution from the list using a QOC Analysis for the
                        solutions that best suit the needs of the customers. It led me to select the combination of a
                        drag and drop board for creative projects and a zoomable canvas space
                        for organization. Both these solutions could be implemented as a web application, thus I decided
                        to design a web platform.</p>

                        Using the wireframe and sketches, I moved on to creating a low fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. I
                        used this lo-fi prototype to complete a series of user tests with my classmates and detect areas
                        where my application could be improved as I am moving on to design the final, high-fidelity

                        information and tried to make it as minimalistic as possible. <br> <br>
                        As I finalized the design, I also created a UI Kit of the most important elements of the
                        application which included the icons, the photos, buttons, etc. </p>
