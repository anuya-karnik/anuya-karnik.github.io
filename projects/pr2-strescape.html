                    <h1>Strescape: Gamifying Mental Health</h1>

                        causing stress while providing an interactive gaming experience. The player works through a
                        series of puzzles and clues similar to an escape room setting with guided mindfulness chats
                        between each puzzle with the game agent.</p>

                    <p>I worked on designing this game for the CHI 2021 Student Game Competition with three other
                        teammates who are also Master's of Information Science students. We also received guidance
                        from
                        Dr. Carol
                        Scott (Post Doctoral Research Fellow, Social Work) for conducting background research on the
                        topics of stress, mental health, mindfulness for high school students.</p>

                    <p>Our goal was to create a <strong>transformative and transgressive play</strong> where we expanded
                        traditional
                        gameplay by using a gaming interface to provide high school student with a game that
                        motivates
                        them to
                        recognize and process their stress and the factors contributing to it.</p>

                    <p>
                        We started by brainstorming as many problems as we could solve using a game
                        based on transgressive and transformative play and organized our ideas in a table as we
                        moved
                        ahead.

                        went through stressful situations of some type.</p>

                    <p>
                        To further solidify and define the idea, conducted background research under the guidance of Dr.
                        Carol, we researched various concepts of mental health such as
                        stress, anxiety, mindfulness, and meditation. From our research, we defined our problem
                        statement and solution as follows:</p>

                        <p>
                            Students in high school struggle with stress and anxiety regarding peer pressure,
                            academics, parental expectations and most of the time these issues go unnoticed due to
                            social stigma.

                        <p>
                            Our solution would be targeted towards helping students recognize, process and possibly
                            reduce the impact of the stress and anxiety they are facing as well as motivate the students
                            to
                            be aware of their issues and seek help

                        <li>Maintaining a calming aesthetic, using the primary color scheme of a desaturated purple and
