                    <h1>Strescape: Gamifying Mental Health</h1>
                    <p>Strescape is a game designed for high school students to recognize and process the factors
                        causing stress while providing an interactive gaming experience. The player works through a
                        series of puzzles and clues similar to an escape room setting with guided mindfulness chats
                        between each puzzle with the game agent. ​</p>

                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>I worked on designing this game for the CHI 2021 Student Game Competition with three other teammates
                    who are also Master's of Information Science students. We also received guidance from Dr. Carol
                    Scott (Post Doctoral Research Fellow, Social Work) for conducting background research on the topics
                    of stress, mental health, mindfulness for high school students.</p>

                <p>Our goal was to create a transformative and transgressive play where we expanded traditional gameplay
                    by using a gaming interface to provide high school student with a game that motivates them to
                    recognize and process their stress and the factors contributing to it.</p>
                <p>Here is a quick overview of the game:</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    We started with brainstorming problems that we could solve using a game. We also brainstormed about
                    various games and puzzle ideas we could used to integrate with the solution. We converted the rough
                    ideas into a matrix that defined the target audience, tools and technology, platforms, etc. that
                    could be used in creating a impactful solutions. After assessing all of the ideas, we each of us
                    voted to choose an idea based on how unique it was. And we all unanimously voted for combining a
                    calming escape room experience with stress management for students!</p>

                <h2>Background Research</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the guidance of Dr. Carol, we researched various concepts of mental health such as stress,
                    anxiety, mindfulness, and meditation. From our research, we concluded the following:</p>

                ​<ul>
                    <li> Students in high school struggle with stress and anxiety regarding peer pressure, academics,
                        parental expectations and most of the time these issues go unnoticed due to social stigma.
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating a solution targeted towards helping students recognize, process and possibly reduce the
                        impact of the stress and anxiety they are facing.
                    </li>
                    <li>The solution may also motivate the students to be aware of their issues and seek help through
                        providing suggestions.
                    </li>
                    <li> The solution may also provide insights to people close to the students such as counsellors and
                        teachers and help them be more aware and empathetic about their student’s mental health.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Once we narrowed our target user group down to high school students, we decided to design the game
                    for smartphone devices making them available to the user whenever they needed to reflect on their
                    stress and the factors contributing to it.</p>

                <h2>User Personas and Scenarios
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the background research and competitive analysis, we were able to create user personas
                    which helped us assess the needs and the goals of our user related to our game. We also created
                    detailed user scenarios which allowed us to discover the flow of the game. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The user scenario also helped us realize the puzzles in the game should not be very complex as
                        the effect of the game itself being stressful would be counterintuitive to the overall of goal
                        of the game which is to help students in managing their stress.</li>
                    <li>It also led us to deciding on adding another functionality to the game - a journal that stores
                        player's progress.</li>

                <p>Once we all had an outline of how the game would function we started with creating sketches and
                    wireframes for the screens of the game.

                    would be placed between each of the puzzles as shown in the game flowmap below.

                <h2>Visual Design Elements
                </h2>
                <p>As we moved on to prototyping, it was important to define the visual identity of the game which
                    included the fonts, color scheme and design style. After looking for inspirations and creating
                    moodboards for different color schemes, we defined our visual identity as shown.​</p>
                <p>For the prototype, we developed one theme for the escape room: gardening as the activity is calming
                    in a real setting as well as involves concepts of growth and nourishment, which we used as parallels
                    for the nourishing your mind to grow. Based on this concept, we chose a calming and contrasting
                    color scheme with purple and yellow with lower saturation as the primary color scheme for text and
                    icons. We also created a secondary color scheme by adding contrasting pair and continuing the
                    pattern of using lower saturation in the colors with red-green, pink-green, blue-orange. Using this
                    pattern allowed us to maintain overall of goal of the game to be calming and relaxing.</p>
                <p>Most of the main elements for the game (pots, plants, books, etc.) were designed in Adobe
                    Illustrator. We maintained a flat design style overall with minimal use of gradients for portraying
                    depth in background elements like the greenhouse background.</p>
