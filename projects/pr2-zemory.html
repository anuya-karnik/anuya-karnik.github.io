                    <p>Zemory is an interactive, multipurpose web interface for millennial parents to collect, organize, as well as create sharable collages from their children's photos. ​</p>

                    <h4>Ideation</h4>
                    <p>
                        I started my ideation by finding out how parents organize their children's photos and how they further use them for creative projects such as collages and photo books. To strengthen my research, I further conducted four user interviews with parents of
                        children between the ages of 0-15 years and found out that: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parents backup their children's pictures on multiple storage spaces including cloud storage and physical memory devices such as hard drives.</li>
                        <li>They often have goals to collect the best photos of their children and organize them creatively in photobooks and collages, especially for occasions like graduation and birthdays.</li>
                        <li>Some parents also want to filter and collect the best photos to create meaningful collections that they can pass on to their kids.</li>
                        <li>Before backing their phone pictures, most parents do not go into their collections and sort and remove duplicate or blur photos; they simply upload photos as a bulk.</li>
                    </ul> ​​

                    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>Using my ideation, I brainstormed and sketched possible solutions for approaching the problem. These sketches allowed me to define my ideas and how they would act as a tool for the user. It was important to put the user at the forefront
                        at this stage as it would allow me to see which of my solutions would work the best in solving the user's problem.</p>

                    <h4>Question-Option-Criteria (QOC) Analysis</h4>
                    <p>
                        I further worked on evaluating the best solution from the list using a QOC Analysis for the solutions that best suit the needs of the customers. It led me to select the combination of a drag and drop board for creative projects and a zoomable canvas space
                        for organization. Both these solutions could be implemented as a web application, thus I decided to design a web platform.</p>

                        Thus, the best solution found using the QOC was a Photo Board Application (A Drag-drop Board + Zoom In-out Board):
