                    <h1>Adobe XD Daily Creative Challenge</h1>
                    <p> <strong>The Challenge </strong><br>
                        In this 9-day challenge hosted by Adobe Live on Behance, where I developed a series of user
                        interfaces that utilized an array of prototyping features in Adobe XD such as Auto-Animations
                        and 3D-Transforms. I also had the opportunity to share my designs with other designers working
                        on this challenge and receive feedback from industry professionals and Adobe mentors. ​</p>

                    <h2>Exhibiting Creativity Within Constraints</h2>
                    <p>While the prompts for each day were decided by Adobe's Mentors - for example, a hobby randomizer,
                        a hairstyle generator, etc. - I wanted to put my own twist on the themes. So I kept confections
                        and baked goods as the central theme for my designs while exploring various fonts and color
                        schemes throughout the project.</p>

                    <h2>Exploring Color Schemes and Fonts</h2>
                    <p>Developing this set of experiences while following an experienced UX/UI Designer, Andrea Eppy
                        allowed me to enhance my knowledge of fonts and their usage. For the color scheme, I decided to
                        focus on pastel colors for most of my designs, which allowed me to maintain cohesiveness between
                        all designs, without making them seem too identical. I experimented a lot with tones and shades,
                        studying concepts such as brightness, saturation, and contrast very closely.</p>

                    <h2>Key Lessons</h2>
                    <p>The project was great to enhance my skills in prototyping as well as building a workflow for
                        designing a UI system from start to end. The feedback from the mentors and my peers provided me
                        with great insight as to how can I keep improving my design skills. <br> <br>

                        Furthermore, placing the theme of confections and baked goods at the center of the entire
                        challenge has sparked a lot of ideas of how I can convert this into a case study for a single
                        application.</p>
